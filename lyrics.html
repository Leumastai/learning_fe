        <br>
        <p>When the days are cold</p>
        <p>And the cards all fold</p>
        <p>And the saints we see are all made of gold</p>
        <p>When your dreams all fail</p>
        <p>And the ones we hail</p>
        <p>Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale</p>

        <pre>
            I wanna hide the truth
            I wanna shelter you
            But with the beast inside
            There's nowhere we can hide
            No matter what we breed
            We still are made of greed
            This is my kingdom come
            This is my kingdom come
        </pre>

        <p>When you feel my heat, look into my eyes</p>
        <p>It's where my demons hide</p>
        <p>It's where my demons hide</p>
        <p>Don't get too close, it's dark inside</p>
        <p>It's where my demons hide</p>
        <p>It's where my demons hide</p>

        <pre>
            At the curtain's call
            It's the last of all
            When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
            So they dug your grave
            And the masquerade
            Will come calling out at the mess you've made
        </pre>

        <p>Don't wanna let you down</p>
        <p>But I am hell-bound</p>
        <p>Though this is all for you</p>
        <p>Don't wanna hide the truth</p>
        <p>No matter what we breed</p>
        <p>We still are made of greed</p>
        <p>This is my kingdom come</p>
        <p>This is my kingdom come</p>

        <pre>
            When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
            It's where my demons hide
            It's where my demons hide
            Don't get too close, it's dark inside
            It's where my demons hide
            It's where my demons hide
        </pre>

        <br>
        <pre>
            They say it's what you make
            I say it's up to fate
            It's woven in my soul
            I need to let you go
            Your eyes, they shine so bright
            I wanna save that light
            I can't escape this now
            Unless you show me how
        </pre>

        <p>When you feel my heat, look into my eyes</p>
        <p>It's where my demons hide</p>
        <p>It's where my demons hide</p>
        <p>Don't get too close, it's dark inside</p>
        <p>It's where my demons hide</p>
        <p>It's where my demons hide</p>
